 * applications where a transaction should be closed most of the time,
 * while the GUI should still be able to read data from the database.
 * 
 * Note that in a setting with multiple concurrent persistence managers,
 * this may result in inconsistencies because
 * any values that were read outside of a transaction may be outdated by
 * the time when the next transaction commits.
