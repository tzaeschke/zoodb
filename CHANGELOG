CHANGELOG
=========

2020-May-01
===========
- T. Zaeschke
  - Changed license from GNU GPLv3 to Apache APL 2.0 (Issue #74)

2020-Apr-28
===========
- Queries (2018-Jan-14):
  V4 query compiler/executor: This is still somewhat experimental. ZooDB uses by default V3 and
  resorts to V4 only for advanced query features.
  - Declared Variables (only partial support, may cause UnsupportedOperationException on compilation)
  - Math operations, such as +,-,*,/,%, ...
  - Right/left hand sides are fully interchangeable
  - Queries constrained by contains()
  - The Engine will use the old V3 parser where possible because execution is 2x faster.
    In rare cases, (left/right sides changed), the Engine will wrongly detect a V3 query
    where the V4 parser would be required, please fix the queries to work with V3 in this case.
- T.Zaeschke (2018-Jan-13)
  - Fixed issue #104 : Characters in queries don't work as expected
