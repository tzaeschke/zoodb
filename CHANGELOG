URGENT:

TODO NOW:
- Fix #114:
  - Assure Test_021_::testThatLastCommitPrevails() works
  - Simplify to read RootPage into a single objects (as all other pages in the DB!!!
  - Merge!

- For other problems:
  - Fix min/max TX id in FSM, this is broken!!!!
  - Retest with wait(10) after commit() -> Seems to work, test with Peptide!
  - Check for other (wrong) usages of TX-ID
  - Try:
    - Allow only single concurrent reader
    - Flush after every page write! Flush after every write!!!! Just for testing!
    - Double check usage/rollback of retry() in concurrent test write()
    - close/reopen file after each commit() -> Flush problem??
    - Generally check flush
    -
//	    why do we revert?
//	            After a failed optimistic verification, we only need to
//	            clean up the TxOidRegistry (if a anything).
//
//	            Nevertheless, revrt() should work, but that is a diufferent story:
//	                -> Brute force test by enforcing revert before/after every commit?
//	    System.out.println("RootRevert: " + rootPageID + " by " + this); // TODO




SessionManager::commitInfrastructure():290
- Think about handling retained objects!
  -> Can we ignore this for now (no read-consistency check)?
DiskAccessOneFile::revert():603
- revert more stuff?

Failure may be during commit()... do we keep any state except client cache? Channels/Sinks?

TODO: Remove empty TX from SessionManager..

Test:
 - enable/disable field index
 - enable/disable schema auto creation
 - enable disable retain values
